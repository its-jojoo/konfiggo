# konfiggo
Konfiggo is a zero-dependency Go library for loading app configuration from environment variables into typed structs. Declarative tags for defaults and required fields, fail-fast validation, and human-friendly errors. Your struct becomes the config contract—clean, explicit, and production-ready.
